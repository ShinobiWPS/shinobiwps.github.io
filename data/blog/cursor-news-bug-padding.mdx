title: Cursor's NES layout spaced off
summary: Cursor NES suggestions were not readable, and the solution was non-intuitive

Some time ago I was fully focused, inside Cursor,inside focus's Cursor and Cursor's focus, when i started noticing something was off, after a few days, or maybe weeks? i don't recall ðŸ˜…
Cursor NES suggestions were completely off actually and that made the suggestion, unreadable:

After quite a while of digging on google, the old ancient way, and some trial-and-error, i found the culprit (and the "bugfix" ), even though, frankly, it didn't make sense:

After i set it to `0`, everything went back to "normal"

Even though it was my fault to set the value initially (some time ago), the value is not intuitive in its behavior considering what it affected. This is undocumented and non-intuitive,  definitely worsening the usability in Cursor.
